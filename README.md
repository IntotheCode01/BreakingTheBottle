BreakingTheBottle
=================

A new repository for a new organization for a fledgling freelance company...

From here, I intend to branch out from Github in Windows and GitExtensions to Sublime Text Editor 2, which I discoved a couple of a days ago and still haven't recovered from the stunning experience of so many resources in one place.  

I want to combine all three resources to create as beautiful projects as I can, hopefully utilizing Adobe Photoshop and Creative Cloud to give them the best appearances I can so that any clients I manage cases can feel as though they've been given the best they can get for what they ask and pay for.

Above all, if I can help anyone, then I can feel accomplished.
