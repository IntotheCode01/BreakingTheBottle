"MAYBE WE SHOULD DEVELOP A CRAYOLA BOMB AS OUR NEXT SECRET WEAPON. A HAPPINESS WEAPON. A BEAUTY BOMB. AND EVERY TIME A CRISIS DEVELOPED, WE WOULD LAUNCH ONE. IT WOULD EXPLODE HIGH IN THE AIR - EXPLODE SOFTLY - AND SEND THOUSANDS, MILLIONS, OF LITTLE PARACHUTES INTO THE AIR. FLOATING DOWN TO EARTH - BOXES OF CRAYOLAS. AND WE WOULDN'T GO CHEAP, EITHER - NOT LITTLE BOXES OF EIGHT. BOXES OF SIXTY-FOUR, WITH THE SHARPENER BUILT RIGHT IN. WITH SILVER AND GOLD AND COPPER, MAGENTA AND PEACH AND LIME, AMBER AND UMBER AND ALL THE REST. AND PEOPLE WOULD SMILE AND GET A LITTLE FUNNY LOOK ON THEIR FACES AND COVER THE WORLD WITH IMAGINATION." - ROBERT FULGHUM AS GANKED FROM <lj user="jenncho">'S WEBSITE

AND THEN, THE MAGAZINES TRICK THE WOMEN. THE MAGAZINES START PICKING AT YOUR SELF-ESTEEM. EVERY PAGE YOU TURN, YOU START FEELING FATTER AND UGLIER, AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR CLOTHES AREN’T GOOD ENOUGH -- AND THE MAGAZINES HAVE YOU FORGETTING HOW FUCKING BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE. – DAVE CHAPPELLE; <i>KILLING THEM SOFTLY</i>, AUGUST 2005

WELL, I SEEM TO DO THINGS WHICH GET THAT REACTION. WE WERE BANNED FROM SAYING WHICH WAY WE WERE VOTING AND WEREN'T ALLOWED TO WEAR PINS BEFORE THE ELECTION. I IMMEDIATELY DEDICATED THE ENTIRE SIDE OF MY CAMPER TO HOW MUCH OF AN ASSHOLE BUSH IS. OH DEAR, PLEASE DON'T SAY I SAID THE PRESIDENT'S AN ASSHOLE. - VINCENT D'ONOFRIO 

ON THE ONE HAND, PEOPLE THINK THEY OWN KIDS; THEY FEEL THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TELL THE KIDS WHAT TO DO. ON THE OTHER HAND, PEOPLE ENVY KIDS. WE'D LIKE TO BE KIDS OUR WHOLE LIVES. KIDS GET TO DO WHAT THEY DO. THEY LIVE ON THEIR INSTINCTS. - DAVID DUCHOVNY

HERE'S A HINT TO ALL YOU NEWLY MINTED PARENTS OUT THERE... YOU CAN'T FORCE YOUR KIDS TO RESPECT YOU OR HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU... YOU HAVE TO EARN THEIR RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE. YOU HAVE TO TREAT YOUR KIDS WITH RESPECT, SET CLEAR AND SIMPLE RULES THAT MEAN SOMETHING, AND KEEP THE PROMISES YOU MAKE. THE SAME THING GOES FOR OUR COUNTRY... WHEN KIDS SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND ARE CONSTANTLY ASKING THEMSELVES, "WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING?", THEN IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT CONFIDENCE AND RESPECT FOR OUR GOVERNMENT IS LOW. - <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/9/8/75930/92972">GODWHATAKLUTZ</a>

TAKING A PAGE FROM AMERICA'S RETAILERS, PRESIDENT BUSH IS GETTING A JUMP ON THE COMING BATTLE OVER IRAQ WAR FUNDING. ON MONDAY, HE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL $45.9 BILLION IN SUPPLEMENTAL WAR FUNDING TO THE $150.5 BILLION HE'D ALREADY REQUESTED, AND THEN TURNED UP THE HEAT ON CONGRESS TO SIGN OFF ON THE $196.4 BILLION BEFORE HEADING HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS. ONLY 60 MORE BROWBEATING DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS! - <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington">ARIANA HUFFINGTON</a>

WHEN THEY SAY THEY CAN'T DO WITHOUT TORTURE -- AS THE BUSH REPUBLICANS HAVE SINCE 9/11 -- THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY LYING. WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT IF THEY CAN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING BETTER THAN TORTURE, THEY'RE LAZY, INCOMPETENT AND UNIMAGINATIVE. EVEN WORSE: THEY'RE SADISTIC AND CRIMINALLY INSANE. - <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-cesca">BOB CESCA</a>

MAYBE IF I LIVED OUT IN THE STICKS, I WOULD HUNT, TOO!  OKAY, BUT I LIVE IN THE CITY SO I HUNT BOOKS AND -- AND IDEAS AND LEARN TO THINK FOR MYSELF. - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/seanbedlam">SEANBEDLAM</a>

WE NEVER DISCUSS PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPTH BECAUSE HEY, WHO CARES IF THE PRESIDENT'S A BOMB-HAPPY DRY-DRUNK TRYING TO PLAY OUT AN OEDIPAL WAR WITH HIS FATHER? 

IT SEEMS TO ME INCREDIBLE THAT ANYONE WITHOUT A UTERUS WOULD TRY TO DICTATE WHAT A WOMAN SHOULD DO WITH HERS. 

PERHAPS THEY'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT EVERY GREAT EMPIRE -- FROM PERSIA TO GREECE TO ROME -- FELL WHEN IT SPENT MORE ON WAR THAN ON ITS PEOPLE. 

I'VE OFTEN FOUND THAT GAY PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT MARRIAGE THAN STRAIGHT PEOPLE. THEY DON'T GET ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE ABOUT SEX FOR SEX'S SAKE. AT LEAST THIS IS TRUE FOR GAY MEN. AND THEY DON'T RUN TO BUST UP A PERFECTLY COZY UNION BECAUSE ONE MEMBER OF THE COUPLE -- OR BOTH -- HAS A FLING. SOME COUPLES ARE FAITHFUL AND SOME NOT. AND THEY SEEM TO PRACTICE THIS WITHOUT THE TERRITORIALITY AND HYPOCRISY OF MIXED-SEX COUPLES. ACTUALLY, THEY SHOULD BE OUR ROLE MODELS IN MARRIAGE. THEY TAKE IT FAR MORE SERIOUSLY THAN STRAIGHT PEOPLE -- PERHAPS BECAUSE IT WAS FORBIDDEN FOR SO LONG. - <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erica-jong">ERICA JONG</a>

DO ME THE FOLLOWING FAVOR -- APOLOGIZE TO YOUR CHILDREN FOR NOT STOPPING THE WAR THAT HILLARY VOTED FOR, THE WAR THAT IS GOING TO IMPOVERISH THEM. THEN APOLOGIZE TO THEM FOR THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THEIR LIVES HELL. THEN APOLOGIZE TO THEM FOR THE SCHOOL SHOOTING THEY MAY SOMEDAY SEE, THE ONE WHERE THE KID GETS THE GUNS OUT OF HIS FATHER'S GUN CASE, OR BUYS AT A GUNSHOW. APOLOGIZE TO THEM FOR THE MEANINGLESS WARS THEY ARE GOING TO FIGHT AND PAY FOR. THEN TELL THEM THAT "AMERICAN VALUES" KILLED THEIR HOPES AND MAYBE KILLED THEM. AND ASK THEM IF THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH IT. - <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley">JANE SMILEY</a>

NO INDIVIDUAL PRESIDENT CAN COMPARE TO THE SECOND BUSH -- GLIB, CONTEMPTUOUS, IGNORANT, INCURIOUS, A DUPE OF ANYONE WHO HUMORS HIS DELUDED BELIEF IN HIS HEROIC SELF, HE HAS BANKRUPTED THE COUNTRY WITH HIS DISASTROUS WAR AND HIS TAX BREAKS FOR THE RICH, TRAMPLED ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS, APPOINTED FOXES IN EVERY HENHOUSE, COMPOUNDED THE TERRORIST THREAT, TURNED A BLIND EYE TO TORTURE AND CORRUPTION AND A LOOMING ECOLOGICAL DISASTER, AND SQUANDERED THE REST OF THE WORLD'S GOODWILL. IN SHORT, NO OTHER PRESIDENT'S FAULTS HAVE HAD SO DELETERIOUS AN EFFECT ON NOT ONLY THE COUNTRY BUT THE WORLD AT LARGE. - ANONYMOUS HISTORIAN (DAMN, DAMN, DAMN)

THE USE OF SOLAR ENERGY HAS NOT BEEN OPENED UP BECAUSE THE OIL INDUSTRY DOES NOT OWN THE SUN. - RALPH NADER

UNLIKE SO MANY HORRIBLE THINGS, WAL-MART CANNOT BE BLAMED ON GEORGE W. BUSH. - LIZA FEATHERSTONE; 'DOWN AND OUT IN DISCOUNT AMERICA,' THE NATION; 16 DEC, 2004

YOU CANNOT SPILL A DROP OF AMERICAN BLOOD, WITHOUT SPILLING THE BLOOD OF THE WHOLE WORLD. WE ARE NOT A NARROW TRIBE. - HERMAN MELVILLE

A WRITER WAKES UP WITH HIS MOUTH FULL OF PITY. - ERNEST HEMINGWAY

WE DO NOT QUITE SAY THAT THE NEW IS MORE VALUABLE BECAUSE IT FITS IN; BUT IT'S FITTING IN IS A TEST OF ITS VALUE - A TEST, IT IS TRUE, WHICH CAN ONLY BE SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY APPLIED, FOR WE ARE NONE OF US INFALLIBLE JUDGE OF CONFORMITY. 
 
WE MIGHT REMIND OURSELVES THAT CRITICISM IS AS INEVITABLE AS BREATHING, AND THAT WE SHOULD BE NONE THE WORSE FOR ARTICULATING WHAT PASSES IN OUR MINDS WHEN WE READ A BOOK AND FEEL AN EMOTION ABOUT IT, FOR CRITICIZING OUR OWN MINDS IN THEIR WORK OF CRITICISM. - T.S. ELIOT

THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN, THE QUALITY OF THEIR EDUCATION, OR THE JOY OF THEIR PLAY. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE BEAUTY OF OUR POETRY OR THE STRENGTH OF OUR MARRIAGES; THE INTELLIGENCE OF OUR PUBLIC DEBATE OR THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PUBLIC OFFICIALS. IT MEASURES NEITHER OUR WIT NOR OUR COURAGE; NEITHER OUR WISDOM NOR OUR LEARNING; NEITHER OUR COMPASSION NOR OUR DEVOTION TO OUR COUNTRY; IT MEASURES EVERYTHING, IN SHORT, EXCEPT THAT WHICH MAKES LIFE WORTHWHILE. - ROBERT FRANCIS KENNEDY, SR.

WAR ON THE ONE HAND IS SUCH A TERRIBLE, SUCH AN ATROCIOUS THING, THAT NO MAN, ESPECIALLY NO CHRISTIAN MAN, HAS THE RIGHT TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEGINNING IT. - LEO TOLSTOY

COMMENTS AND CRITICISM: AUTHORS NEED THE FORMER TO SURVIVE -- WITHOUT IT THEY EITHER CURL UP INTO A BALL AND DIE, OR BUY AN UZI AND TAKE OUT A K-MART. THEY DON'T LIKE THE LATTER, AND WILL OFTEN RESPOND WITH POSTS THE SIZE OF DOCTORAL THESES AS TO WHY THEY ARE RIGHT AND YOU ARE WRONG. - ANDREW DYNON AS GANKED FROM <lj user="_vicodin">'s USER INFO PAGE

GOD IS DEAD. GOD REMAINS DEAD. AND WE HAVE KILLED HIM. HOW SHALL WE, MURDERERS OF ALL MURDERERS, CONSOLE OURSELVES? THAT WHICH WAS THE HOLIEST AND MIGHTIEST OF ALL THAT THE WORLD HAS YET POSSESSED HAS BLED TO DEATH UNDER OUR KNIVES. WHO WILL WIPE THIS BLOOD OFF US? WITH WHAT WATER COULD WE PURIFY OURSELVES? WHAT FESTIVALS OF ATONEMENT, WHAT SACRED GAMES SHALL WE NEED TO INVENT? IS NOT THE GREATEST OF THIS DEED TOO GREAT FOR US? MUST WE NOT OURSELVES BECOME GODS SIMPLY TO BE WORTHY OF IT? 

HE WHO FIGHTS WITH MONSTERS MIGHT TAKE CARE LEST HE THEREBY BECOME A MONSTER. AND IF YOU GAZE FOR LONG INTO AN ABYSS, THE ABYSS GAZES ALSO INTO YOU. 

BEWARE OF SPITTING AGAINST THE WIND. - FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, THE GAY SCIENCE; BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL

YOU KIDS WANT TO KNOW WHERE IRAQ IS, THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES WILL SPONSOR AN ALL-EXPENSE PAID TRIP. 

I STAND BY THIS MAN. I STAND BY THIS MAN BECAUSE HE STANDS FOR THINGS. NOT ONLY FOR THINGS, HE STANDS <i>ON</i> THINGS. THINGS LIKE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND RUBBLE AND RECENTLY FLOODED CITY SQUARES. AND THAT SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE, THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO AMERICA, SHE WILL ALWAYS REBOUND — WITH THE MOST POWERFULLY STAGED PHOTO OPS IN THE WORLD.

MOST TRUTHS ARE SO NAKED THAT PEOPLE FEEL SORRY FOR THEM AND TRY TO COVER THEM UP, AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT. - EDWARD R. MURROW

PEOPLE HERE DRIVE LIKE BABOONS ON CRACK -- THEY'VE STOLEN THE KEYS AND SORT OF FIGURED OUT HOW TO SWITCH THE THING ON. I'M JUST STAGGERED BY IT. 

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES ME FEEL GUILTY ABOUT PLAYING THIS ROLE IS THAT MY DAD WAS A DOCTOR. HE WAS A VERY GENTLE SOUL AND, I THINK, A VERY GOOD DOCTOR. AND I'M PROBABLY BEING PAID MORE TO BECOME A FAKE VERSION OF MY OWN FATHER. - JAMES HUGH CALUM LAURIE

IF GOD DOES NOT HELP US, EVERYONE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WILL BE STINKY DRUNKARDS AND ONLY A HOLE WILL BE LEFT ON THE SITE OF OUR LOVELY LAKE. - NEWS STORY ABOUT RUSSIAN LAKE BEING TURNED TO 30% PROOF VODKA AFTER MALFUNCTION OF NEARBY DISTILLERY.

AZRAEL: HUMAN, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO HELL? I THINK NOT. YOU KNOW ONCE HELL WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THE ABSENCE OF GOD. AND IF YOU HAD EVER BEEN IN HIS PRESENCE, YOU WOULD KNOW THAT'S PUNISHMENT ENOUGH. BUT THEN, YOUR KIND CAME ALONG, AND MADE IT *SO MUCH WORSE*. 
BETHANY: HUMAN BEINGS AREN'T CAPABLE OF 1/100 THE EVIL A SHITBAG DEMON LIKE YOU IS. 
[SPITS ON HIM] 
AZRAEL: EVIL IS AN *ABSTRACT*! IT'S A *HUMAN* CONSTRUCT! BUT TRUE TO HIS IRRESPONSIBLE NATURE, MAN WON'T OWN UP TO BEING ITS ENGINEER. SO HE CHOOSES TO BLAME HIS DARK DEEDS ON MY ILK. BUT HIS SELFISHNESS IS LIMITLESS. IT WASN'T ENOUGH JUST TO SHADOW HIS OWN EXISTENCE, HE TURNED HELL INTO A *SUFFERING PIT*! FIRE, WAILING, DARKNESS! THE KIND OF PLACE *ANYONE* WOULD DO *ANYTHING* TO GET OUT OF! AND WHY? BECAUSE HE LACKS THE ABILITY TO FORGIVE HIMSELF! IT IS BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION TO DO SIMPLE RECOMPENSE FOR THE SINS YOU COMMIT. NO, YOU CHOOSE INSTEAD TO INVENT A PSYCHO-DRAMA AND DWELL IN FOUNDLESS BELIEF THAT GOD COULD NEVER FORGIVE YOUR GRIEVOUS OFFENSES. SO YOU BRING YOUR GUILT AND YOUR INNER DECAY WITH YOU TO HELL WHERE THE HORRID IMAGINATIONS OF THOUSANDS OF GLUTTONS FOR PUNISHMENT GAVE BIRTH TO THE SICKNESS THAT HAS INFECTED THE ABYSS SINCE THE FIRST ONE OF YOUR KIND ARRIVED THERE, BEGGING TO BE PUNISHED! IN DOING SO, HE TRANSFORMED HELL FROM COLD AND SOLITUDE TO *PAIN* AND *MISERY*! I'VE SPENT EONS, PRIVY TO THE FLAMES, INHALING THE DECAY, HEARING THE WAIL OF THE DAMNED. 
[SHOUTS] 
AZRAEL: I KNOW WHAT EFFECT SUCH HORRORS HAVE ON THE DELICATE PSYCHE OF AN ANGELIC BEING! 
[TO BETHANY] 
AZRAEL: WOULD YOU LIKE A GLIMPSE AT PAIN ETERNAL? *LOOK*! 
[AZRAEL PLACES HIS HAND OVER BETHANY'S EYES AND FOR 10 SECONDS WE SEE SOME OF THE MOST FUCKED UP AND DISTURBING IMAGERY THAT CAN BE CRAMMED INTO 240 FRAMES OF FILM] 
AZRAEL: I'D RATHER NOT EXIST THEN GO BACK TO THAT. AND IF EVERYBODY HAS TO GO WITH ME, SO BE IT!


I AM THE MOTHER WHO TOLD HER LESBIAN DAUGHTER TO INVITE HER GIRLFRIEND OVER FOR DINNER.
I AM THE FATHER WHO PUNISHED HIS SON FOR CALLING YOU A FAG.
I AM THE PREACHER WHO TOLD MY CONGREGATION THAT LOVE, NOT HATE, IS THE DEFINITION OF A TRUE FOLLOWER OF GOD.
I AM THE GIRL WHO DID NOT LEARN THE MEANING OF "HOMOSEXUAL" UNTIL HIGH SCHOOL, BUT NEVER THOUGHT TO QUESTION WHY TWO MEN MIGHT BE KISSING.
I AM THE WOMAN WHO ARGUES (QUITE LOUDLY AND VEHEMENTLY) WITH THE BIGOTS WHO INSIST THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARRY OR RAISE CHILDREN.
WE ARE THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASS WHO AGREES, UNANIMOUSLY, ALONG WITH OUR TEACHER, THAT LOVE SHOULD BE ALL THAT MATTERS.

IF YOU AGREE, REPOST THIS. DO IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID. YOU CAN HANDLE IT. YOU'RE STRONGER THAN YOU THINK.
I AM MAKING A DIFFERENCE. HATE WILL NOT WIN.
