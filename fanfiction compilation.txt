Neither one had moved, though John imagined that the lines in Greg's face had gotten even deeper in the few hours he'd been here. Part of him wondered if his son was trying to race him toward death.

<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/pathologies/25164.html">PART FIVE</a> <i>"Shut up, House," Jimmy and Lisa interject simultaneously, but he doesn't even falter. He expects them to try to shut him up and they expect him to ignore them. Comfortable patterns.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/331104.html">PROLOGUE, PART ONE</a> <i>He knew patience was a virtue that Angel had more than mastered, but it always bothered Gibbs to test it.</i>, <i>Before long, he had every inch of the boy memorized.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/331515.html">PART TWO</a> <i>He'd kill them both tomorrow.  Right now, his head was too liquidated to plan how but as soon as he got an idea, he was going to make...</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/331858.html">PART THREE</a> <i>"Boss," Tony tried without success not to whimper, ducking away from Gibbs and spinning to face him. "When he volunteered to fix my boiler, I didn't know it was because he'd built a bomb and -- "</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/332088.html">PART FOUR</a> <i>Connor smiled fully, then, remembering that Earth hadn't felt so bad at all at the time.  "I think...I think it was being back with him after so long.  I felt like I was at...at </i>home<i>, you know?"

Gibbs nodded.  Connor didn't need to explain.  He got that feeling as soon as Angel had stepped off that airplane and that was only </i>this<i> time.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/332376.html">PART FIVE</a> <i>"You failed, dear boy, in being weaker than I."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/332866.html">PART SIX</a> <i>Connor opened his eyes to find his sight blurry again.  He grit his teeth and swiped at his face with the sleeve not concealing his stake-launcher.  "Why are you doing this?"

Gibbs frowned deeply and continued to watch Connor as he cried, saying nothing, but Connor could see the words as though they were streaming from his mouth.  </i>Because you need to remember once and for all what family is.

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/333416.html">PART SEVEN</a> <i>Kate froze, remembering Tony's enthused description of Connor's past. "Yeah, I guess so -- but, I mean, it can't have been easy, being the son of..."

Gibbs smiled bitterly then, pain flashing across his face that lanced through Kate and left her eyes prickling.

"It wasn't -- isn't and never will be easy. It's just the way things are, though."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/333684.html">PART EIGHT</a> <i>Gibbs rolled his eyes, admittedly relieved when Angel didn't see. "I think you're being ridiculous, sir."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/344940.html">PART NINE</a> <i>It was like a play, he decided, but his mouth was patently unable to cooperate. His father's footsteps brought the other man into view and suddenly he was staring at a face he wouldn't be able to forget if he tried, and God, had he tried.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/345614.html">PART TEN</a> <i>"And something tells me you know exactly how creepy you look right this moment and you really don't give a damn."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/353079.html">PART ELEVEN</a> <i>The circle is complete...almost.

He's aware he's rather insane but, of course, it doesn't bother him.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/360510.html">PART TWELVE</a> <i>Mom told him that if anything happened to her, he and Dad were to go seek out Angelus as fast as they could.

But Dad was dead. And now Mom was dead, too.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/362581.html">PART THIRTEEN</a> <i>"A case I worked last month just became this family's business, sir, and from the looks of the scene, you're a part of it."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/367142.html">PART FOURTEEN</a> <i>Gibbs raised an eyebrow and resisted the urge to glance up at his baby brother. "You'd be surprised. Too much can be too much, even for us -- will you stop pacing, jackass!" He growled up at Connor, who froze, his body pivoting to stare deathly calmly down at Gibbs. "If you contaminate my crime scene, I'm tossing you off the George Washington Bridge!"</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/368328.html">PART FIFTEEN</a> <i>"I did not intend ter cause my son the distress I did, but my intentions matter not. By the time Liam left...he rather rightly assumed I did not love him an' he firmly held that...that belief when he...when he died."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/369524.html">PART SIXTEEN</a> <i>He looked back at her. "What the hell did the Senior Partners do to me, Lilah? I've spat in their faces before, they've never gone at me directly. They always go at everyone I happen to give a damn about. Why hurt me now?"</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/369795.html">PART SEVENTEEN</a> <i>Angel stepped back and away from Eve, running a hand through his now-regrown hair as his eyes landed on Connor. Kaitlin, he knew, understood to an extent just by the nature of her being. "Damn, this is going to be hard to explain."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/374379.html">PART EIGHTEEN</a> <i>But, then again, this was what they did -- the odds stacked themselves against them, they ignored that and waited for the fallout. It was everything they did.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/376060.html">PART NINETEEN</a> <i>And Wes had barked a laugh then, sarcastically, bitterly, helplessly. Angel's smile held the same pain as he continued.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/376199.html">PART TWENTY</a> <i>Lindsey frowned at the boxes of Band-Aids. "These are nothin', just a little prank. If any of 'em could, they'd slit my damned throat and I'd deserve it and you know it."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/377333.html">PART TWENTY-ONE</a> <i>Lilah smiled bitterly before reaching into her suit jacket pocket and removing a one dollar bill, until recently ironed flat by heat and still smelling of sulfur. "We made this bet, remember? One of us was going to be first..."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/377632.html">PART TWENTY-TWO</a> <i>Angel waited until Ducky had left before he looked at Ari and Ziva. "I'm sorry. He -- Leroy feels very strongly about families being split apart. I'm certain you heard why."</i></lj-cut>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/371289.html">Stained</a> <i>Connor shivered, his eyes burning as he shut them against the tableau, not wanting to say it was real, but not wanting to call it a façade but knowing his life hadn't gone this way. Nothing had gone this way and he</i> knew <i>it.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/371571.html">Novice</a> <i>Yes, she fully admits that with behavior like that she'll be this smug herself someday. For now, she's just grateful it hasn't come yet and she waits.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/371895.html">Invitation</a> <i>"You're hurt, sir," he said instead, concern filling his voice and quieting it.

Angel seemed to want to sigh but was forced to stop when that sigh turned into him audibly holding back a pained noise. "Y-you wo-ouldn't be wrong."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/372399.html">Disagreement</a> <i>He'd never made Buffy cry before, that he knew. That was like a punch in the gut from every Slayer in the ICW at least twice over.

But the scariest part was that Buffy's tears had taken on a...a strange...dear God, was that </i>blood?

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/372553.html">Fodder</a> <i>"He was trying to protect you from -- "

"His dark side?"

Xander's head whipped up before he could stop it and only now could he see Willow was crying, despite her astonishingly calm voice.

"Gee, wonder what that's like."</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/373231.html">Splitting</a> <i>Xander found himself unable to look away from the stricken expression on Sam's face and, for the first time, it didn't occur to him that Sam was a demon.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/373231.html">Reconciling</a> <i>"I am the dispassion," Thomas growled against her skin, sending ripples down her soul.

"I am the love," Angel whispered, a smile then blooming within her.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/383364.html">Urge</a> <i>He wanted to float away, to -- Angel and Thomas wouldn't allow him to perceive the word for his greatest wish at that moment -- whatever, to find what he knew would stop this.</i></lj-cut>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/354965.html">PROLOGUE</a> <i>This couldn't be real. It couldn't, but here were Shannon and Kelly, whole -- solid, not reduced to bloody little...dear God...</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/356955.html">PART ONE</a> <i>The blood drained from Ed's face and he slumped forward, staring at his hands. He didn't say anything and Al watched him miserably, knowing they both felt the same.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/359809.html">PART TWO</a> <i>Agent Gibbs was sitting across from her, bent over in his chair, his hands clenching his previously meticulous hair, tears falling onto the table beneath him, his breaths deep, long, shuddering.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/361998.html">PART THREE</a> <i>Then it was over, as quickly as it had started, and Gibbs was gasping for breath, slumping forward onto the table as tears matching his own stared back at him.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/364022.html">PART FOUR</a> <i>"...Mustang?" Edward said weakly, an infuriated look slamming onto his face a moment later.  "You...you...I KNEW!  I KNEW IT!  AL, GET OVER HERE FOR A MINUTE!"</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/366796.html">PART FIVE</a> <i>The ache of separation is gone but we're useful only in giving direction.  It's the price we paid.</i>

<a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/378816.html">PART SIX</a> <i>"Go get Ed and Al settled, Jethro," Gracia soothed, a watery smile on her face as she shooed the three of them forward.  "We'll be right here when you and Al get back."</i></lj-cut>
